# Ghost Towns of the World

Ghost towns have always been a facination to me. They exist like an old photo album, all the evidence of life remains but time has moved on. Ghost towns are simply towns without a population. This can occur over time with the closing of an industry in town or very suddenly with a flood or meltdown of a nuclear powerplant nearby. 

They can be incredibly tragic or simply a demonstration of time moving on.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
