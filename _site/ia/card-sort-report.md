## Observations

- The participants commonly did not recognise the names of the towns but the general areas of the world they belonged to. Most of there questions were in regards to where these towns were situated in the world.
- The results were very similar to my expectations. 
- Because the cities have their own reasons for being Ghost towns I had to restrain myself from explaining their story. I feel with a little more knowledge their organisation would be different.
